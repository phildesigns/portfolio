# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the GitHub repository of my personal portfolio. It aims at displaying some of my projects in the domain of arts and webdesign (development and graphism mostly).

It ain't yet complete and I'm still unsure about many of its final aspects.

# Links and Ressources

The portfolio is currently hosted [here](https://phildesigns.github.io/portfolio). For now it makes uses of GitHub Pages; I might host it on a dedicated domain one day.

# Technical Specs

The websites makes use of the following technologies:
* VueJS
* CSS (No framework, just pure CSS)
* Dynamic content (using custom-made JSON feeds)
* Currently uses WordPress and Custom Post Types (but I'm planning of making my own editing forms)
